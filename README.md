BOOM Bound is a Fast-paced, Real-time, Strategic Movement and Pattern mobile game.

The goal of the game is to have the player maneuver his/her character in and out of deadly explosions to get to the beacon on the other side of the map. These levels have been refined, played and battle-tested over and over many times giving the perfect balance of difficulty and enjoyment.

With thousands of seconds enjoyed (wasted?) on every single level, over 100,000 explosion in-game related deaths and 1 million in-game explosions daily youâ€™ll enjoy the adrenaline rush!
(NO PLAYERS WERE HARMED DURING THE PLAYING OF THIS GAME!)

The game consists of:
* 100 unique levels
* 8 unique themes 
* 8 unique explosion animations
